# Using Blade Components in Laravel

This exercise shows how blade components can be used to create reusable UI elements in your Laravel applications.

## Context

I am working on a Laravel project that has opted to avoid the use of
SPAs and focus on traditional server-side rendering for a more
straightforward user experience. To make server-side rendering easier
to manage, I wanted to explore how Laravel's Blade components worked to
improve the reusability and maintainability of my views.
