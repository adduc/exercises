# Pagination in Laravel

This is a simple Laravel project demonstrating the use of custom pagination views using Laravel's built-in pagination functionality.

## Context

I was working on a Laravel project and had a few routes I wanted to
paginate. Along with using Laravel's built-in pagination, I wanted to customize the pagination views to fit the design of my application.
