# Running Ansible within Docker

This exercise demonstrates how Ansible can be run within a Docker
container to provide a consistent and isolated environment to run
playbooks and manage configurations effectively.

## Usage

Both a docker-compose file and a Makefile are provided to simplify the
process of running Ansible within Docker.

Running `make` will list available recipes and their descriptions.
