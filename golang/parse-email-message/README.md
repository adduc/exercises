# Exercise: Parsing email messages in Golang

This exercise shows how the [mnako/letters]() library can be used to parse email messages in Golang.

## Context

I would like to accept incoming email messages through AWS' SES, but while SES parses the email headers, it leaves the exercise of parsing the email body to the developer.
