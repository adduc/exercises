# Exercise: Interacting with DynamoDB using Golang

This exercise demonstrates how items can be put into a DynamoDB table using Golang and the v2 AWS SDK.

## Context

A project I'm working on requires storing and retrieving user data from a DynamoDB table. I wanted to implement initial interactions with DynamoDB in a standalone exercise before integrating it into the project.
