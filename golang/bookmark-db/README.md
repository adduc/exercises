# Golang-based Bookmark Database

This is a simple web application that allows users to store and retrieve bookmarks. It is written in Golang and uses a SQLite database to store the bookmarks.

## Context

My experience with Golang had primarily been limited to operational scripts and "template"-driven projects, like writing a terraform provider. I wanted to build a typical web application to get a better feel for how the directory structure and code organization would look like.
