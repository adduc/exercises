# Using Victoria Metrics in a Kubernetes Cluster

This exercise demonstrates deploying helm charts for Victoria Metrics
and Node Exporter using Terraform. It can be useful for monitoring
Kubernetes clusters and applications.

## Context

I have experience running Prometheus in docker-based situations. While
it works well for smaller setups, I wanted to explore using Victoria
Metrics in a Kubernetes environment as a potentially easier way to
manage monitoring and metrics collection.
