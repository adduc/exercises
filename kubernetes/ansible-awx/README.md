# Running Ansible AWX on Kubernetes

This exercise demonstrates how to deploy Ansible AWX on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Context

I have experience using Docker to run Ansible playbooks locally and in CI/CD pipelines in a containerized manner, but have not yet explored solutions that would allow scaling out how Ansible is run. I have heard mixed reviews of Ansible AWX, but want to play with it to see if it might be a good fit for my needs.
