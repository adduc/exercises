## Thoughts

- This was incredibly easy to set up for CPU-only usage. I wonder how difficult it would be to get AMD-based GPUs working.

- The Web Search integration did not result in accurate results when
using a small model (`qwen-0.6b`) to ask when the White Sox last won
the World Series. When I switched to a larger model (`qwen-8b`), it was
able to provide the correct answer. I'm curious what happens
behind-the-scenes to summarize the search results and how much context
is provided to the model.
