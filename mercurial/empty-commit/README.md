# Creating empty commits in Mercurial

This exercise creates an alias in Mercurial to allow for creating empty commits easily. Empty commits can be useful for various purposes, such as triggering CI/CD pipelines without making actual changes to the codebase.

## Testing

A Makefile is included in the repository that can be used to test the configuration. The following command can be used to test the configuration:

```bash
make test
```
