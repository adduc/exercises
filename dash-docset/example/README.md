# Exercise: creating an example Dash/Zeal docset

## Context

I love using Zeal as a way to keep documentation offline for instant
lookup, but I occasionally find that the documentation I need isn't
available. I wanted to create an example docset to measure the effort
required to create a docset for a library I use.

## Lessons learned

- Zeal's docsets can be thought of as a collection of HTML files, with
  a few extra files to help with navigation and search.
