# Exercise: Creating an SNS Topic forwarding to an SQS Queue

This exercise demonstrates how an SNS topic can be created to forward messages to an SQS queue. All actions are logged to CloudWatch Logs, whether successful or not.

## Context

I had some trouble setting up an SNS topic to forward messages to an
SQS queue for another project, and wanted to create the resources in an
sandbox to figure out a solution. This exercise is a result of that.
