# Exercise: Golang Bookmark API in a "single file"

This is a simple bookmark management application written in Golang. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete bookmarks. The application uses a SQLite database to store the bookmarks.

## Context

I have struggled to find a directory structure for a Golang project that I like, running into dependency cycles and other issues. To temporarily mitigate this, I wanted to create a project where all the code lived in a single file. Then I could refactor it into a more traditional structure later.
