# Exercise: Using IPv6 with various AWS services

This exercise shows how a VPC can be provisioned with both IPv4 and IPv6, along with various resources that can be used to demonstrate IPv6 networking.

## Context

Most exercises, tutorials, and other showcases of AWS infrastructure-as-code that I have come across rely on IPv4 for networking. While this works, with AWS starting to charge for IPv4 addresses, I want to explore using IPv6 instead where possible.
